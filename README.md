# GradeBook

GradeBook is a web application built to allow students to calculate the average grade on remaining assignments that is required to achieve a specific grade. For example, if a student wants to know what grade they need to make on the next 3 homework assignments and final examine in order to make a 90% in the class, this is where GradeBook comes in!

## Usage

First, a user can be created with any email address. As of v1.0.0, the email attached to a user is arbitrary, so anyone can sign up.

GradeBook requires a few user inputs to get started:

* Target grade - the desired grade a student wants to receive in a class
* Assignment - name of a particular assignment (i.e. "Homework", "Exam 1", etc...)
* Points Worth - the amount of points the particular assignment is worth (if in percentage, then points = percentage)
* % Grade - if the assignment was completed and graded, the student must input the grade they received for that particular assignment

Finally, an excel workbook of all your courses can be downloaded.
